# Changelog

All notable changes to Super Processor are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- `review JOB` serves a localhost split page. It lists each segment's range,
  context, problem, and still. Accept and a note call the existing `segment`
  command.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- A named fault filters one segment's treatments. A sentence maps onto that
  fault list only after a fault rejection. Neighbors keep the treatment they
  already shared.
- `plans JOB --choose N` is the approval to render. Each kept segment is
  encoded with libx265, audio is cut on the same timestamps, and the parts
  are concatenated.
- The size-cap bitrate uses the sum of the kept durations.

### Fixed

- A split of an oversized range stays at least 5 seconds from both ends, so a
  loud change at the edge cannot leave a piece shorter than 5 seconds.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- A fixed treatment list for each segment problem. Silhouette lifts shadows
  harder than low light. Strong denoise cannot share a treatment with sharpen,
  and steps stay in allowlist order.
- Five timeline plans. The first is the highest score. Later plans change as
  many look groups as they can, and neighbors that share a look share a
  treatment. `plans JOB` writes `plans.json` and prints each assignment.
- A three-second preview window around each key frame, clamped inside that
  treatment's trim, and one cached encode of that window.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- Split loop for a local file: one-hertz sample rows, segments of 5–120
  seconds (at most 15, files over 30 minutes refused), a context and problem
  label, one still per segment, and shared look groups.
- `segment` prints a proposed split. `--note` re-splits inside those bounds
  (too many, too few, a boundary move, or a relabel). `--accept` records the
  timeline; a second accept leaves the job unchanged.
- Sharpen and trim on the recipe allowlist. Sharpen stays inside a mild
  unsharp range. A trim must keep at least 5 seconds.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- Classical saliency-aware 9:16 reframe (edge-energy subject tracking) with
  planned crop windows wired into FFmpeg templates.
- Structured LLM recipe patches (`{"patches":[...]}`) outside `--safe-mode`,
  still clamped to allowlisted ops/params.
- Optional OS keyring lookup for API keys via `keyring` when installed.
- Doctor checks for `libx265`, vid.stab / `deshake`, and optional `libvmaf`.
- `--acknowledge-size-risk` on diagnose / plan / apply / job reframe so a
  below-floor size cap becomes an explicit warning instead of a hard error.
- Live encode progress on stderr during preview and apply.

### Changed

- Package classifier moved from Pre-Alpha to Alpha.
- Local `.dogfood/` artifacts are gitignored.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- End-to-end product loop: diagnose → plan → preview → apply → show.
- CV look/motion estimators, recipe validation, FFmpeg templates, QA, VMAF
  helper, and safe-mode LLM/VLM advisory planning.
- Soft stabilize fallback to `deshake` when vid.stab is unavailable.
