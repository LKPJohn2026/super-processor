# Changelog

All notable changes to Super Processor are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Wizard quality path is a capped SeedVR2-3B restore (strength 0.0–0.35) plus
  RTX Video Super Resolution (`LOW` / `MEDIUM` / `HIGH`), encoded with
  `hevc_nvenc`. Notes that call the image artificial cannot raise those knobs.
  Install needs an NVIDIA driver, an RTX GPU, `nvvfx`, and SeedVR2-3B weights.
  ComfyUI is not used. Legacy CLI diagnose/plan/apply keep FFmpeg templates.

### Planned

- Wire a real local LLM path behind the deferred stub screen (OpenAI-compatible
  or native multimodal endpoint).

## [2.6.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- Localhost website UI for the wizard: polished server-rendered screens with
  step rail, LLM type choice (Gemini live + deferred local stub), lettered
  split/enhance options, and the full sketch flow through result/happy.
- CI HTTP test drives the wizard website from introduction through done
  (FakeTransport Gemini + FFmpeg), asserting each screen’s copy and step rail.

### Fixed

- Wizard tests that encode tiny clips skip when `ffmpeg` is missing from
  `PATH` (cibuildwheel / headless release environments).

## [2.5.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- Enhance **Something else** loop: `combine_enhance_revise_message` /
  `revise_enhance` feed the user note plus prior structured options back into
  Gemini; the wizard stays on the segment until an option is previewed and
  accepted (tests cover five revise rounds).

## [2.4.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- Localhost Gemini wizard via `super-processor review` (no job id): setup,
  pick file, structured split choice, per-segment options with short previews,
  enhance-and-concat render, and a happy/revise result step.
- Gemini structured-output client (`gemini.py`) with chat persistence,
  dynamic-FPS sampling, allowlisted ops validation, and failover across
  multimodal models with usable RPM.
- Design docs: revised [docs/system-design.md](docs/system-design.md) and new
  [docs/ui-wizard.md](docs/ui-wizard.md).
- CI job **Gemini live API** calls the real Gemini structured-output endpoints
  using the repository secret `Gemini_API_Test` (mapped to `GEMINI_API_KEY`).

### Changed

- Wizard product path uses Gemini for split/diagnosis; classical CV estimators
  are not used by the wizard. Export keeps source aspect (no vertical social
  default).
- Matrix unit tests run with `-m "not gemini_live"` and never receive the
  Gemini secret; live split/enhance/multi-turn checks run only in the dedicated
  job.

### Fixed

- Gemini API key storage works without an OS keyring backend (headless CI).
- Live Gemini calls close HTTP error bodies, retry transient 503s, and skip
  image-generation models when discovering candidates.
- Windows CI retries Chocolatey FFmpeg installs and skips ffmpeg-dependent
  wizard tests when the binary is missing from `PATH`.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- Hardware-decode sample tests pass an explicit ffmpeg path, so wheel
  builds no longer fail when the image has no FFmpeg binary.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- `doctor` lists `hevc_cuvid`, `hevc_qsv`, `hevc_amf`, and
  `hevc_videotoolbox` next to the hardware encoders.
- `segment JOB --decode NAME` reads sample frames with that decoder. One-hertz
  rows keep the same shape. A decoder this ffmpeg does not have fails before
  sampling.
- A frame the device cannot decode is read again in software. The sample row
  and the segment label match a software read.

### Fixed

- The hardware-encoder doctor check and `plans --choose` test no longer
  require `ffmpeg` on `PATH`. Wheel builds were failing when the image had
  no FFmpeg binary.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- `doctor` reports `hevc_nvenc`, `hevc_qsv`, `hevc_amf`, and
  `hevc_videotoolbox` as present or missing. `libx265` stays required.
- A recipe may name one of those encoders. Any other codec name fails
  validation. The default remains `libx265`.
- `plans JOB --choose N --encoder NAME` renders with that encoder's own
  rate-control flags. Trim and the filter graph stay the same. A missing
  device fails with the doctor line before any segment is encoded.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- `review JOB` serves a localhost split page. It lists each segment's range,
  context, problem, and still. Accept and a note call the existing `segment`
  command.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- A named fault filters one segment's treatments. A sentence maps onto that
  fault list only after a fault rejection. Neighbors keep the treatment they
  already shared.
- `plans JOB --choose N` is the approval to render. Each kept segment is
  encoded with libx265, audio is cut on the same timestamps, and the parts
  are concatenated.
- The size-cap bitrate uses the sum of the kept durations.

### Fixed

- A split of an oversized range stays at least 5 seconds from both ends, so a
  loud change at the edge cannot leave a piece shorter than 5 seconds.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- A fixed treatment list for each segment problem. Silhouette lifts shadows
  harder than low light. Strong denoise cannot share a treatment with sharpen,
  and steps stay in allowlist order.
- Five timeline plans. The first is the highest score. Later plans change as
  many look groups as they can, and neighbors that share a look share a
  treatment. `plans JOB` writes `plans.json` and prints each assignment.
- A three-second preview window around each key frame, clamped inside that
  treatment's trim, and one cached encode of that window.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- Split loop for a local file: one-hertz sample rows, segments of 5–120
  seconds (at most 15, files over 30 minutes refused), a context and problem
  label, one still per segment, and shared look groups.
- `segment` prints a proposed split. `--note` re-splits inside those bounds
  (too many, too few, a boundary move, or a relabel). `--accept` records the
  timeline; a second accept leaves the job unchanged.
- Sharpen and trim on the recipe allowlist. Sharpen stays inside a mild
  unsharp range. A trim must keep at least 5 seconds.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- Classical saliency-aware 9:16 reframe (edge-energy subject tracking) with
  planned crop windows wired into FFmpeg templates.
- Structured LLM recipe patches (`{"patches":[...]}`) outside `--safe-mode`,
  still clamped to allowlisted ops/params.
- Optional OS keyring lookup for API keys via `keyring` when installed.
- Doctor checks for `libx265`, vid.stab / `deshake`, and optional `libvmaf`.
- `--acknowledge-size-risk` on diagnose / plan / apply / job reframe so a
  below-floor size cap becomes an explicit warning instead of a hard error.
- Live encode progress on stderr during preview and apply.

### Changed

- Package classifier moved from Pre-Alpha to Alpha.
- Local `.dogfood/` artifacts are gitignored.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- End-to-end product loop: diagnose → plan → preview → apply → show.
- CV look/motion estimators, recipe validation, FFmpeg templates, QA, VMAF
  helper, and safe-mode LLM/VLM advisory planning.
- Soft stabilize fallback to `deshake` when vid.stab is unavailable.
